As a newbie to Git, Terminal, GitHub and GitHub Desktop, I'm fumbling along, groping my way towards an understanding of this complex and daunting environment. Along the way I'm making notes and creating record. The record appears chaotic -- quite simply, that's because it is!

However, unlike the GitHub tutorials, which are written by experts--but experts who so often, it seems to me, have forgotten what it's like to be a beginner--this is written by a beginner.

It may never be of any value to anyone but myself, but this is my journey to an understanding.
