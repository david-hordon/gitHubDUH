  		<h3>What I don't understand about branches</h3>
  			<p>I don't understand how I can access your gutHub account in order to push an amended branch, for eample. I managed to create a new branch in your gitHubDUH repo which I called DavidPageBranch, thinking I would amend some of the text you had already put there, but have since realised that a new branch is a 'reproduction' of your complete repo. This now makes sense to me because I might well want to make amends to the css, for example, which would be in another file.</p>
  			<p>I usually link to a gitHub repo through the command line which is where I can create new branches and having made changes push that branch back to be assessed and then merged, if agreed, by the administrator – usually me – but in this case you (because it is your repo and I don't have your login passwords to access your account and push the branch I have worked on.</p>
  			<p>Clearly I can see your repo through my gitHub account but I am not sure how that happens. So far I have simply clicked on the link that came with the inite to collaborate. Anyway, I will try various ways of downloading my changes. (By the way, do you like my new 'avatar'? It's much like the old one but I got rid of the pastel colour and added a shadow to give it a bit of oooommpf!)</p>
  			<p>I will make some minor amends to your page to test that you can see what I have done, and if you are happy you can merge with your master.</p>
